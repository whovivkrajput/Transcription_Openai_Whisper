# Transcription_Openai_Whisper
Used openai whisper to built a service where audio can be converted to text, exposed it with streamlit.
Consist a poc.ipynb under research folder , where you can find code for a quick poc.
Further step would be to expose it with an api for further use.
To run with streamlit , run command  "streamlit run app.py"
Here whisper base and whisper small models were used , you can use large for better output.
